# About Me

<img src="/images/yongquanqu01.jpg" class="floatpic" width="300" height="400">
My name is Yongquan Qu.  I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of
Earth and Environmental Engineering at Columbia University, advised by [Pierre Gentine]. 
I am also affiliated with [LEAP-STC] as a graduate research assistant.

I'm interested in studying deep learning methods and their integration with numerical methods 
for the simulation of physical processes in atmospheric and climate dynamics. Currently, I am starting 
to explore data-driven low-cloud parameterization, and data assimilation for climate.

Before coming to Columbia, I obtained my M.Phil. degree in Atmospheric Environmental Science from Hong Kong University of 
Science and Technology, supervised by [Xiaoming Shi]. At HKUST, my research was to use differentiable numerical 
solver and transfer learning to improve deep learning based parameterization. Prior to HKUST, I obtained my B.Sc degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Lanzhou 
University. I was an undergraduate research assistant in Yu-Mei Huang's Group, mainly studying sparse representation and
convolutional sparse representation for image processing.
