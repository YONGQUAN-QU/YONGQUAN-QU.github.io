# About Me

<img src="/images/yongquanqu01.jpg" class="floatpic" width="300" height="400">
My name is Yongquan Qu, a second-year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of
Earth and Environmental Engineering at Columbia University, advised by [Pierre Gentine]. I am a graduate research assistant of the [NSF Science and Technology Center “Learning the Earth with Artificial Intelligence and Physics” (LEAP)]. I am also affiliated with the [“Multiscale Machine Learning In Coupled Earth System Modeling” (M2LInES) project] - an international collaborative project to improve climate models with scientific machine learning.
I'm generally interested in studying deep learning methods and their integration with numerical methods 
for the simulation of physical processes in atmospheric and climate dynamics. Currently, my primary research delves into enhancing the modeling and understanding of turbulence in the atmospheric boundary layer with scientific machine learning. I am also working on developing a hybrid framework that integrates machine learning with data assimilation in the context of climate projections. 

Before coming to Columbia, I obtained my M.Phil. degree in Atmospheric Environmental Science from Hong Kong University of 
Science and Technology, supervised by [Xiaoming Shi]. At HKUST, my research was to use differentiable numerical 
solver and transfer learning to improve deep learning based parameterization. Prior to HKUST, I obtained my B.Sc degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Lanzhou 
University. I was an undergraduate research assistant in Yu-Mei Huang's Group, mainly studying sparse representation and
convolutional sparse representation for image processing.
